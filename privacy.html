					<h2><b>Free Poll Privacy Policy</b></h2>
					<p>Last updated: December 7, 2018</p>
					<p>Your privacy is important to us. It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we
					may collect from you across our website, <a href="https://simplepoll.rocks">https://simplepoll.rocks</a>, and other sites we own and operate. Simple Poll is based
					on the premise of keeping most of the user experience within Slack. As such, it makes an effort to store the minimum amount
					of data required to run the service and to collect analytics to improve it.</p>
					<h4>1. Information we collect</h4>
					<h5>Log data</h5>
					<p>When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the standard data provided by your web browser. It may include
					your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, the pages you visit, the time and date of
					your visit, the time spent on each page, and other details.</p>
					<h5>Personal information</h5>
					<p>We may ask for, or receive from Slack after your approval, personal information, such as your:</p>
					<ul>
							<li>Name</li>
							<li>Email</li>
					</ul>
					<h5>Business data</h5>
					<p>Business data refers to data that accumulates over the normal course of operation on our platform. This may include transaction
					records, stored files, user profiles, analytics data and other metrics, as well as other types of information, created or
					generated, as users interact with our services.</p>
					<h4>2. Legal bases for processing</h4>
					<p>We will process your personal information lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. We collect and process information
					about you only where we have legal bases for doing so.</p>
					<p>These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them, meaning we collect and use your information only where:</p>
					<ul>
							<li>it’s necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering
							into such a contract (for example, when we provide a service you request from us);</li>
							<li>it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and
							development, and to protect our legal rights and interests;</li>
							<li>you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose (for example, you might consent to us sending you marketing emails);
							or</li>
							<li>we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Where you consent to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any
					time (but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place).</p>
					<p>We don’t keep personal information for longer than is necessary. While we retain this information, we will protect it within
					commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
					That said, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and cannot guarantee absolute data
					security. If necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal obligation or in order to
					protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.</p>
					<h4>3. Collection and use of information</h4>
					<p>We may collect, hold, use and disclose information for the following purposes and personal information will not be further
					processed in a manner that is incompatible with these purposes:</p>
					<ul>
							<li>to provide you with our platform’s core features;</li>
							<li>to process any transactional or ongoing payments;</li>
							<li>to contact and communicate with you; and</li>
							<li>for internal record keeping and administrative purposes.</li>
					</ul>
					<h5>Slack</h5>
					<p>Simple Poll is an app for the Slack service and integrates tightly with it. Almost all data that Simple Poll collects originates
					from Slack. As such, you may find it useful to review the relevant Slack policies including the Slack privacy policy. You
					can find it at: <a href="https://slack.com/legal">https://slack.com/legal</a></p>
					<p>The data that instruct Slack to pass to Simple Poll is stored, so that interaction with the Slack API is possible and so
					that you can manage your own polls in the best possible way. This includes the poll content, votes, access token, team and
					user metadata.</p>
					<p>By design, Simple Poll has very little access to the data in your Slack workspace: Simple Poll cannot view any activities
					in any of the channels and it also does not have access to any of your files. The only data it can access is the data that
					you are sending via button presses (to for example vote) and slash commands (/poll "Question?" "Option1" "Option2"). In this
					example Simple Poll will receive the text of the slash command, namely '"Question?" "Option1" "Option2"'. This data is stored
					for the purpose of you using it at a later stage, to for example manage your own polls.</p>
					<h5>Age limitations</h5>
					<p>Use of the Simple Poll service is not permitted for children under the age of 16. If you are aware of anyone under the age
					of 16 having supplied us with personal data, please contact us so that we can take steps to delete such information.</p>
					<h4>4. Disclosure of personal information to third parties</h4>
					<p>We may disclose personal information to third party service providers for the purpose of enabling them to provide their services,
					including (without limitation) IT service providers, data storage, web-hosting and server providers, professional advisors
					and payment systems operators.</p>
					<p>Simple Poll does not display any advertisements, and does not share any data with advertisers.</p>
					<h4>5. International transfers of personal information</h4>
					<p>The personal information we collect is stored and processed in United States and United Kingdom, or where we or our partners,
					affiliates and third-party providers maintain facilities. By providing us with your personal information, you consent to
					the disclosure to these overseas third parties.</p>
					<p>We will ensure that any transfer of personal information from countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries
					outside the EEA will be protected by appropriate safeguards, for example by using standard data protection clauses approved
					by the European Commission, or the use of binding corporate rules or other legally accepted means.</p>
					<p>Where we transfer personal information from a non-EEA country to another country, you acknowledge that third parties in other
					jurisdictions may not be subject to similar data protection laws to the ones in our jurisdiction. There are risks if any
					such third party engages in any act or practice that would contravene the data privacy laws in our jurisdiction and this
					might mean that you will not be able to seek redress under our jurisdiction’s privacy laws.</p>
					<h4>6. Your rights and controlling your personal information</h4>
					<p><strong>Choice and consent</strong>: By providing personal information to us, you consent to us collecting, holding, using and disclosing your personal information
					in accordance with this privacy policy. If you are under 16 years of age, you are not permitted to use this service. You
					do not have to provide personal information to us, however, if you do not, it may affect your use of this website or the
					products and/or services offered on or through it.</p>
					<p><strong>Information from third parties</strong>: If we receive personal information about you from a third party, we will protect is as set out in this privacy policy. If
					you are a third party providing personal information about somebody else, you represent and warrant that you have such person’s
					consent to provide the personal information to us.</p>
					<p><strong>Restrict</strong>: You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information. If you have previously agreed to us using
					your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by opting out via the Simple
					Poll dashboard or by contacting us using the details below. If you ask us to restrict or limit how we process your personal
					information, we will let you know how the restriction affects your use of our website or products and services.</p>
					<p><strong>Access and data portability</strong>: You may request details of the personal information that we hold about you. You may request a copy of the personal information
					we hold about you. Where possible, we will provide this information in CSV format or other easily readable machine format.
					You may request that we erase the personal information we hold about you at any time. You may also request that we transfer
					this personal information to another third party.</p>
					<p><strong>Correction</strong>: If you believe that any information we hold about you is inaccurate, out of data, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading, please
					follow the instructions in the Simple Poll dashboard, or contact us using the details below. We will take reasonable steps
					to correct any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or out of date.</p>
					<p><strong>Notification of data breaches</strong>: We will comply with laws applicable to us in respect of any data breach.</p>
					<p><strong>Complaints</strong>: If you believe that we have breached a relevant data protection law and wish to make a complaint, please contact us using
					the details below and provide us with full details of the alleged breach. We will promptly investigate your complaint and
					respond to you, in writing, setting out the outcome of our investigation and the steps we will take to deal with your complaint.
					You also have the right to contact a regulatory body or data protection authority in relation to your complaint.</p>
					<p><strong>Unsubscribe</strong>: To unsubscribe from marketing communications, please opt-out from the Simple Poll dashboard, contact us using the details
					below, or opt-out using the opt-out facilities provided in the communication.</p>
					<p><strong>Automatic deletion</strong>: Your user account (including an email address Simple Poll may store directly) is automatically deleted within 24 months of
					inactivity. Polls you create are automatically deleted within 12 months of inactivity. Data collected as part of Google analytics
					is automatically deleted within 38 months of collection.</p>
					<h4>7. Cookies</h4>
					<p>We rely on “cookies” for certain functionality of the Simple Poll service. A cookie is a small piece of data that our website
					stores on your computer, and accesses each time you visit, so we can understand how you use our service.</p>
					<h4>8. Business transfers</h4>
					<p>If we or our assets are acquired; or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, we would include
					data among the assets transferred to any parties who acquire us. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that
					any parties who acquire us may continue to use your personal information according to this policy.</p>
					<h4>9. Limits of our policy</h4>
					<p>Our website may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content
					and policies of those sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy practices. Similarly,
					Simple Poll is an app for the Slack service and as such, you may find it useful to review the relevant Slack policies including
					the Slack privacy policy. You can find it at: <a href="https://slack.com/legal">https://slack.com/legal</a></p>
					<h4>10. Changes to this policy</h4>
					<p>At our discretion, we may change our privacy policy to reflect current acceptable practices. We will take reasonable steps
					to let users know about changes via our service. Your continued use of this service after any changes to this policy will
					be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information.</p>
					<p>If we make a significant change to this privacy policy, for example changing a lawful basis on which we process your personal
					information, we will ask you to re-consent to the amended privacy policy.</p>
